## Developing strategies to improve alumni association event engagement 

One of our assignments over the fall semester was to provide in depth analytics consulting to the Alumni Association of our University. A little bit of context - 
The UMD Alumni Association was formed in 1989. They serve over 400,000 alumni worldwide and to be a  part of the association, you need to pay a membership fee. 
The association conducts multive events of different types across the year. Our task was to analyse the data and provide recommendations to the Association on how they can improve the attendace rate and get more and more new alums to attend the events. 

#### My thoughts 
At first this dataset looked really easy to deal with, but the more we dug we incurred challenges. There was a fair share of data wrangling required to convert it to a more useful format and preparing it for analysis ! Most of the fields in the dataset were cateforical making it harder to build a regression model. 
We also realised we could create segments in the data to make it more manageable. Overall - I really enjoyed with working with several different types of variables and trying to run regressions using them, I understood that data cleaning and data tranformation is perhaps the most important step when it comes to modelling and analysis.
